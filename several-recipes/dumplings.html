<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This is a flavor-packed recipe of ground beef and mushroom-filled dumplings in
  a savory broth. Top with a drizzle of sesame oil, green onions, and sesame
  seeds for an extra burst of flavor!
</p>
<p>
  There are many different ways to shape dumplings and you can use either
  dumpling or wonton wrappers. Be careful not to overfill the dumplings as that
  may cause them to burst while cooking.
</p>
<p>
  You can either brush the edges of the wrapper with water, or use a spray
  bottle to lightly spray the wrapper edges to help seal the dumpling in your
  chosen shape.

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <p>
    <li>
      Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
      mushrooms and sauté until most of the water from the mushrooms has
      evaporated and mushrooms are slightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic
      and cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Set aside to cool.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
      To make the dumpling filling, combine ground beef, ginger, soy sauce,
      black pepper, green onions, and the cooled mushroom mixture in a large
      mixing bowl. Stir to combine; set aside.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
      To make the broth, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pot over medium heat.
      Add shallots and cook until softened and beginning to brown, about 3-4
      minutes. Add ginger and garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently.
      Add the vegetable broth, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes, and bring to a
      boil, scraping the bottom of the pan as you stir. Reduce heat to low and
      simmer uncovered for at least 10 minutes while you shape the dumplings.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
      To assemble dumplings, place 1 tablespoon filling in the center of each
      wrapper. Brush the edges of wrapper with water (a spray bottle also works
      well to spray the edges) and fold to shape. Seal each dumpling fully,
      leaving no open holes. Repeat until all dumplings are filled.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
      Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working
      in batches, add dumplings to the pan in one even layer and cook uncovered
      until bottoms are golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.
      Carefully add ¼ cup water and immediately cover, letting the dumplings
      steam until golden brown on the bottom and filling is no longer pink at
      the center, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the
      center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Use more olive
      oil If the dumplings are sticking to the pan.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
      Transfer cooked dumplings to a plate; keep warm. Repeat to cook remaining
      dumplings.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
      To serve, place several dumplings in a shallow bowl, then pour over with a
      spoonful of broth. Top with chopped green onions, sesame seeds and a
      drizzle of sesame oil.
